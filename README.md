# vocabulator
A tool for estimating the vocabulary of a given set of texts via a dictionary analysis.

**Usage:**
1. Generate a `dictionary.txt` with makedict and place it in the root folder.
2. Create `/input` and place texts to be analysed within.
3. Run `py vocabulator.py`
4. Results will be found in `vocabulary.txt`

**Notes:**
Since calculating Dicken's vocabulary using his extant corpus of works takes approximately 35 minutes on a reasonably powerful computer (the result was a vocabulary of ~18,000 words!), make a cup of coffee while you wait.

**To-do:**
1. Allow logging of statistics to file.
2. Improve accuracy.
